Trajectories for huboplus.

These trajectories are generated by hubo_turn_wheel.m.

When they run on the real robot, one should have the logitech driving force racing wheel at [0.3 0.09 0.9] in the world coordinate system.

movetraj0: will make the hands go from an initial pose to wheel at 9:15 o'clock position.
movetraj1: will rotate the hands at 10:20 o'clock position.
movetraj2: will go back from 10:20 o'clock to 9:15 o'clock position.
movetraj3: will make the hands go from 9:15 o'clock to back home.

Note that these trajectories don't take into account the angle that the driving wheel makes with its azimuth. When executed, these trajectories will make the hands rotate around the wheel as if the wheel's front face plane is parrallel to world coordinate frame's Z-Y plane.

These trajectories are mainly created for the test runs Nick Alunni, Calder Phillips-Grafflin, Bener Suay, Daniel Lofaro, and Dmitry Berenson will do at MIT on December 17th and 18th.
